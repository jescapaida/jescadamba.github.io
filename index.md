# Introduction

Nyanga Family Clinic was founded in 1989 by the late Dr H.K Dambanemuya. It was situated at Mangondoza Township in Nyanga and later moved to Rochdale the central business district at which it is currently sited. It was founded because there was no private practitioner in the whole of Nyanga district and at some point there was no doctor at the general hospital resulting in the community travelling at least 100 kms for consultation. Nyanga family clinic is a general practice hence everyone is the target population especially the Nyanga District residents. Every patient first sees a general practitioner before getting to a specialist. It offers services such as consultation, Family planning services and counselling, scaling, antenatal care but no deliveries and scanning services. It is registered under the Ministry of Health and has been fully functional since 1989. It is currently being run by Sister Damba who is a qualified nurse and Doctor T.T Chiramba.

## Mission Statement 

Providing the best patient care by treating patients as family with sensitivity and empathy

## Purpose

To cover primary care needs for outpatients in the community dedicated to healing and excellence

# Project Name and Description

The project name is going to be Patient Record Management System. It will be a process of creating a database for patient’s files with different access rights with a user friendly user interface. The nurse and doctor would be having access to the patients’ history, diagnosis and prescription whilst the receptionist would just be able to access basic information such as the person’s address, name, and payment details. It will improve data storage access and enable data driven decision making such as daily reports.

# Problems of the Current System

The current system is a manual or traditional filing system, everything is paper based. Nyanga family clinic was founded in 1990, making it 30 years old. In the health sector patient information is very confidential and vital, meaning it should be kept safe and should be readily available. Since numbers of patients have been accumulating over the years, Storage space has become a problem and some of the papers are now torn and dusty. The file location process is time consuming and tedious because there are a lot of files and they can be easily misplaced as they are more prone to human error. Unauthorized access of files is not restricted since any staff member can just open the file cabinet hence data security is improvised. The main problem with the current system as of recent is that they now have digital scanning systems, Implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD)  and hardware components such as iPads, and MacBooks which record the information their medical devices and their patient information is still in paper.

# Chapter 1: Inception/Initiation

## Introduction

Health information technology is providing patients, clinicians, and researchers with access to data that will enable novel approaches to science and medicine. Digital health records (DHRs) are capable of being shared across different health care settings for the examination of possible trends and long-term changes in a patient's disease progression or status as well as the effectiveness of the health care delivery system. While prevalence of paper records remains high, there has been a rapid trend toward the digitalization of medical and health records in many countries. This project focuses on the designing, development, testing and implementation of a patient record management system for Nyanga Family Clinic. This chapter focuses on problem definition or inception. It includes the background study, the problem statement, a description of the current and proposed system, the objectives, scope and lifecycle model of the project and lastly the literature review.

## Background Study

Globally, institutions in the private and public sector have fully digitized of their entire enterprise, including digital products, channels, and processes, as well as advanced analytics that enable entirely new operating models. Despite the advancements in e-health in other countries, Zimbabwe has little activity where quality healthcare is inaccessible to most of the population in the country (D.S, 2016).Zimbabwe is still way behind when it comes to the health sector being digitalized, most of the major public hospitals such as the Sally Mugabe Hospital still uses the manual system. “Once complete, the process is expected to result in the digitalization of patients’ records as soon as they seek admission at the first hospital after which the same records can be accessed by subsequent departments at all hospitals, including the consulting doctor, further investigations (x-rays a bonus, the Government will be able to assemble instant full statistics, recording and monitoring different disease burdens using the e-system. Once the system has been successfully implemented at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, it is expected to be rolled out to other health institutions.” (Gore, 2020). The government is working on digitalizing the public sector but due to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, it has been temporarily put on hold. This just applies to public hospitals and rural clinics are not included. Nyanga Family Clinic is a healthcare facility for outpatients currently being run by Mrs. M.G Dambanemuya who is a qualified nurse. It is sited in the central business district of a small tourist resort town of Nyanga in Manicaland Zimbabwe. Since it started in 1990 it has been using the manual/ traditional system for its daily processes which include the documentation, filing system, and accounts are all recorded on paper. 

## The problem Statement

Nyanga Family Clinic has been experiencing bad publicity and reputation due to its inability to deliver services to the public effectively. This is due to the misplacement of patient’s records, the patient’s concerns on the privacy and protection of their files and overwhelming workload to the staff. The loss of patient records or misplacement of files is a serious offence and unacceptable in the health sector so it results in losing patients to other clinics or bad publicity. Therefore the purpose of this project is to create a web based Patient record management system. 

## Proposed System

![](./assets/img/framework.jpg)

*Figure 1: An overview of proposed system.*

I propose to develop an Electronic Patient Records (EPR) software application. The software will be a web-based application developed using the Python Flask Web Framework. I will rely on modern front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface. The web application will also comprise a database back-end system developed in SQLlite. Figure 1 provides a general overview of the software system.

## Objectives of the project:

### Primary objectives

+ To develop a digital health system with an interface and database to store patients’ records
+ To computerize the billing system and automate billing systems

### Secondary objectives
+ To provide more secure and efficient data storage and instant access to records
+ To enable data-driven decision making

## Scope of the project
 
This study is focused on designing a web based online patient record management system. The system will be made specifically for implementation at Nyanga Family Clinic. 

### Assumptions
+ That the doctors and staff are capable of using the system
+ That the staff members are ready to migrate to a computerized system
+ That the clinic has reliable internet connectivity

### Limitations
The software system is web-based and cannot be accessed without an internet connection. Since the software is web-based, it is also slower compared to local server-based or desktop applications.

## Lifecycle model

The developer will use the agile lifecycle model since this project/ system is solely based on iterative and incremental development to satisfy customer requirements and needs. The software created should be highly responsive to customer feedback.  When the software is developed it is tested and taken to be reviewed by the customer if it fails to meet the customer’s requirements the developer has to fix or redevelop the software. Below is a diagram illustrating agile development model:

## Literature Review

### Theoretical Framework

The application of technology in health care, in the form of Electronic Health Records (EHR), is the most important and necessary issue in order to improve the quality of health care, and studies have shown that, not only is it a way to integrate information and represent the condition of patients, and a dynamic source for health care, however it leads to gain access to clinical information and records, electronic communications, comprehensive training and management, and ultimately, enhancing the public health. (Farzianpour, 2015). For this study, I have applied Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations framework. Rogers’ innovation theory addresses a wide variety of factors that could affect implementation of an innovation; these include attributes of the innovation, the process of implementation, individual characteristics of, and interactions between, the implementers, and organizational factors. (Greiver, 2011) As Rogers explains, innovation is perceived as an idea, process or a technology that is new or unfamiliar to individuals within a particular area or context, while diffusion is the process by which information about the innovation flows from one person to another over time within the social system (WHO 2016b). The National Health Services Education for Scotland observed that, “Without high quality records and efficient flow of information by health records staff, the quality of patient care would be severely compromised” (Attah, 2012). I chose this theory because the idea of Electronic Health Records in Zimbabwe is relatively new and the rate at which it is diffusing is excruciatingly low in both private and public sectors hence I’m using this theory to support the implementation of my capstone project which is to design and develop an electronic patient record management system for Nyanga Family Clinic.

## Literature review


+ Hospitals have been using Electrical Medical Records (EMRs) for laboratory and radiologic reports, radiologic images, medication lists, and some decision-support functions are available in electronic format. Some systems have even upgraded their information to an electronic-records system by adding functionalities, such as computerized provider-order entry, physicians' notes, and nursing assessments. However, these functionalities are typically more difficult to implement, and it remains unclear whether hospitals will be able to do so successfully. EMRs have are a key factor for improving healthcare quality and safety, reducing adverse events for patients, decreasing costs, optimizing processes, improving clinical research and obtaining best clinical performances. However, hospitals continue to experience resistance from professionals to accepting EMRs. “Most hospitals that had adopted electronic-records systems identified financial factors as having a major positive effect on the likelihood of adoption: additional reimbursement for electronic health record use (82%) and financial incentives for adoption (75%). Other facilitators of adoption included the availability of technical support for the implementation of information technology (47%) and objective third-party evaluations of electronic health record products (35%). Hospitals with and those without electronic-records systems were equally likely to cite these factors (P>0.10 for each comparison)” (Placeholder1) (Anna De Benedictis, 2020).
The developer will develop a web based Electronic Medical record system which focuses on patient record management for storing outpatients’ files and will use the parallel changeover method for implementation for doctors to have time to adapt and get used to the system as they’ll see for themselves that the benefits of using an EMR system.

+ Digitalization can bring a paradigm swing in traditional healthcare systems by minimizing medical errors, promoting healthcare quality, reducing healthcare costs and empowering patients to take care of their medical needs (Catwell .L, 2009). Despite the advancements in e-health in other countries, Zimbabwe has little activity where quality healthcare is inaccessible to most of the population in the country (D.S., 2016). Consequently, several technology introductions in Zimbabwe are mainly customized to each hospital and do not communicate with each other. Zimbabwe has very few hospitals that are fully digitalized. According to a study conducted by Samuel S. Furusa and Alfred Coleman on the topic;  Factors influencing e-health implementation by medical doctors in public hospitals in Zimbabwe, the following factors contribute to the why the healthcare sector of Zimbabwe is not yet digitalized:

+	The lack of technology infrastructure and funding to get the devices, 
+	Most clinicians are technical novices, they do not have adequate ICT skills and knowledge
+	Most hospitals do not have an IT department hence resulting in lack of technical support
+	Security  concerns, the violation of doctor patient confidentiality was an issue of concern pertaining to who had access to the system
+	Resistance to change, most clinicians are now accustomed to the manual system arguing that digitalized systems are more difficult to use
+	Lack of basic medical facilities, hospitals lack basic equipment that an advancement in technology will be a luxury

Therefore Digitization makes it easier for patients and healthcare professionals to remain on the same page. Gone are the days when the patients had to maintain a thick medical records file they needed to bring to every medical appointment. Particularly with medical emergencies, patient history is at the mercy of the attendants who may or may not be well-versed with the patient’s profile. Digitization has leveled this platform to keep both patients and their doctors well informed of every situation.

# Chapter 2:Feasibility Study

## Project Plan

This project is aimed at designing and developing a web based patient record management system. The stages and time frames to be taken or the project plan is illustrated in the Gantt chart below:

![](./assets/img/gantt.jpg)
*Figure 2.0: Gantt Chart.*

## Feasibility Study

It is the evaluation of the practicality and desirability of a proposed project or system. It takes into consideration all the relevant factors such as technical, legal, operational, and scheduling.

### Operational Feasibility

This feasibility study considers the availability of human resources to operate the system. The patient record management system is custom designed to meet the user requirements and needs and the interface will be user friendly implying that the clinic staff will be able to use the system

### Technical Feasibility

Technical feasibility is the assessment of the technical resources and expertise of the project. It determines whether there is valid and sufficient technical resources and expertise to design and develop the system. The clinic already has new hardware devices such as iPads and MacBooks. In this case the developer has knowledge about:
•	SQLite to build the database
•	Visual Studio Code to implement the code
•	Unified Modeling Language for modelling and designing

### Economic Feasibility 

Economic Feasibility measures the cost effectiveness of the project which requires a cost benefit analysis. The software used were downloaded from the internet hence no costs where incurred.

Tangible Benefits

+	Reduces data redundancy
+	Data can be backed up and restored
+	Increased throughput
+	Data reliability is ensured
+	Multiple users can share the file at the same time

Intangible benefits

+	It is portable since it is web based and less office space is consumed

Intangible costs

+	Knowledge required to develop the system
+	Time for implementing and adapting the system
+	Training the staff members on the new system

The benefits in this case outweigh the costs hence the project is economically feasible.

### Legal Feasibility

 This project conforms to all the legal and ethical requirements both in the software development and the health sector.


# Chapter 3: Requirements analysis

## Survey Report


On the 19th of February 2021 an employee satisfaction survey was carried out at Nyanga Family Clinic focused on 8 of its staff members. The survey was conducted to seek permission from Health professionals to conduct a changeover from a manual/traditional/ paper based system to electronic medical records. It was also conducted to identify factors that could affect implementation and that needed to be considered by the developers. The survey was carried out by means of a questionnaire which has been listed in the appendix. The questionnaire consisted of Demographic/ statistical attributes, the knowledge of the health professionals on electronic medical records and closed ended questions on their (the health professionals) readiness to accept the EMRs.

8 questionnaires were distributed, one for each employee. Of the 8 distributed there was all responded giving a 100% participation rate and a 100% completion rate every question in the questionnaire was responded fully. The last respondent submitted their questionnaire on the 22nd of February, 2021. The statistical views indicated that the age range was from 26- 60 years. 25% have diplomas and below and 75% are degree holders.100% has a working experience of more than 2 years in the medical field. 62.5% are computer literate and have access to computers at home, 37,5% have access to computers at work.  Under the knowledge and attitude of EMRs 50% indicated to have knowledge on EMRs and computer related skills, 37.5% have a previous know how of EMRs.100% have positive feelings towards EMRs and believe that EMRs have importance and will improve service quality, patient satisfaction ,and will save money and time. 100% agreed to have the hardware to support EMR implementation. Finally the readiness section indicated that 75% of the respondents are 92% ready for the new system and 37,5% showed 50% readiness of engagement.

In conclusion the whole survey indicated that training will be necessary upon implementation of basic computer skills and how to navigate across the system. The results displayed also showed that the staff members have a positive attitude towards EMRs and are ready to learn more and use it. This gave the developer an insight of how the end-user thinks and their capabilities of using the system.

## Evaluation of Ethical considerations

 Ethical values are universal rules of conduct that provide a practical basis for identifying what kinds of actions, intentions, and motives are valued (Ostman L, 2019). Health records contain both facts and professional opinions on a patient's physical and/or mental health. Consultation notes scan results, videos, audio recordings, photographs, tissue samples and correspondence between professionals all feature in health records. With all this in consideration this system has to be reliable, secure and information should be kept confidential. Respect for patient autonomy requires that patient encounters and information are kept confidential and private; fostering trust and improving communication. (L, 2012) All vital information in the healthcare sector is protected by the Data Protection Act which prescribes ways to address data privacy in the digital world. The following were observed during the development of the patient record management system:

Informed consent: The developer got informed consent to access patient’s records in order to come up with a suitable tailor made system and to be working in their organization abiding by their code of ethics. 

Confidentiality: Confidentiality was observed in all the processes whilst and after handling the medical files.

Anonymity: The people who participated in the research of this study and development of the new system will remain anonymous

The dangers of unethical practices: These will negatively affect the company’s image and reputation since it might result in lawsuits.


# Chapter 4: System Modeling

## System models

System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system (Sommervile, 2016).It helps the analyst understand the functionality of the system and models are used to communicate with the customers.

## Logical Data Modeling

This defines how the system should be implemented regardless of the Database Management System, It gives a clearly detailed description of data regardless of the way it will be physically implemented. below is a description of etities and their attributes

![](./assets/img/ent.jpeg)

*Figure 2.0: A description of entities and their attributes.*

## Entity Relationship Diagram

The diagram below describes in detail the entities involved and the relationships between these entities.

![](./assets/img/ERD.jpg)

*Figure 2.0: Entity Relationship Diagram.*

## Data Flow Diagrams

In this section there is going to be the context diagram for the general outlook and level 0 diagrams to illustrate the functions of the receptionist, administrator and doctor. Below is a data dictionary for the data flow diagrams:

## Class diagrams

This is a representation in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.


![](./assets/img/classd.jpg)
*Figure 2.0: Class Diagram.*

# Chapter 5: System design

## Interface design

The interface was designed as a Graphic User Interface since it makes use of Windows, Icons, Menus and pointers. This was the best option since it is user friendly and easy to navigate. It is illustrated in figure 5.1 below:

![](./assets/img/about.jpg)
*Figure 5.1: Interface Design.*

## Menu Design

The system has a main menu with the standard horizontal design at the top right corner which consists of links to the Search page, New Patient, About page and Logout Page. These can only be accessed when a user logs in to the system with correct credentials. The Menu Page also shows the number of treated patients, number patients still waiting and pending appointments as shown in fig 5.2 below.

![](./assets/img/menu.jpg)
*Figure 5.2: Menu Design.*

## System Architecture


The system has to be authorized by the ministry of health so that they ensure privacy and security so as to authenticate the system before use. Once permission is granted the user accesses the system through the interface designed. Patients’ files are stored in a database located in the cloud. All backups are done on the cloud as shown in fig 5.3 below.


![](./assets/img/archt.jpg)
*Figure 5.3: System Architecture.*

## Model Design

Modules of the proposed application includes the Login Model, The index/Menu, the  search page, the new patient, and logout page.

The login module facilitates access to the system for the employee granting them respective access priviledge:

![](./assets/img/login.jpg)

*Figure 5.4: Login Page.*

The search page allows the user to search for a patient's record in the database and render results:

![](./assets/img/Search.jpg)

*Figure 5.5: Search Page.*

The new patient module is to register a new page, it is used to enter contact details, patient history and billing information depending on access rights

![](./assets/img/patient.jpg)

*Figure 5.6: New Patient Page.*

The about/ contact us page includes a background history of Nyanga Family Clinic, the services provided, contact details (get to know us) and a platform to contact the clinic (Contact Us)

![](./assets/img/contact.jpg)

*Figure 5.7: About/Contact Page.*

# Chapter 6: Implementation

## Program flowchart

This is a diagrammatic representation of the flow of activities in the system from logging in to logging out. A user logs into the system. If the credentials are correct then the menu page is loaded else an error message pops up. When a patient enters the clinic, the receptionist searches for the patients’ file if found then they proceed to enter the patient’s details if else they add a new patient file and save the file. Then finally logout. As illustrated in figure 6.1 below:

![](./assets/img/flowchart.jpg)

*Figure 6.1: Program flowchart.*

## Code

The code of the working system is included in the link below:

# Chapter 7: Testing


Testing a newly developed system is essential so as to ensure accuracy and reliability. It also capacitates verification and validation of code.

## Test cases

Below is the test case of the login page:

![](./assets/img/testcase.jpg)
*Figure 7.1: Login Test case.*

## Test Results
## Unit/ Black Box Testing

Unit/black box testing is for validation, it is used for testing missing functions, interface errors, errors in data structures and analyzing defects. Black box testing is based on the requirements and checks the system to validate against predefined requirements.

### Unit testing


In the Unit testing I started by adding the configurations for testing, To do this I had to delete contents in the confi.py file as the code illustrates below
Config.py
class Config(object):
    """
    Common configurations
    """

    DEBUG = True


class DevelopmentConfig(Config):
    """
    Development configurations
    """

    SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = True


class ProductionConfig(Config):
    """
    Production configurations
    """

    DEBUG = False


class TestingConfig(Config):
    """
    Testing configurations
    """

    TESTING = True

app_config = {
    'development': DevelopmentConfig,
    'production': ProductionConfig,
    'testing': TestingConfig
}

Test.py

# tests.py

import unittest

from flask_testing import TestCase

from app import create_app, db
from app.models import Employee


class TestBase(TestCase):

    def create_app(self):

        # pass in test configurations
        config_name = 'testing'
        app = create_app(config_name)
        app.config.update(
            SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI='mysql://dt_admin:dt2016@localhost/dreamteam_test'
        )
        return app

    def setUp(self):
        """
        Will be called before every test
        """

        db.create_all()

  

        # create test non-admin user
        employee = Employee(username="test_user", password="test2016")

        # save users to database
 
        db.session.add(employee)
        db.session.commit()

    def tearDown(self):
        """
        Will be called after every test
        """

        db.session.remove()
        db.drop_all()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
### Black box testing
This will include the end user's functionality and non functionality tests as illustrated below.



## User Acceptance testing

This is the final test process before the system is transferred into production. It is the process of comparing the system to its initial requirements and the current needs of its end users. The test should be performed by the system's end users or a group of test specialists with assistance from the development group. The test cases can be designed by analyzing the system requirements definition and then formulated by analyzing the acceptance criteria and the system external specifications. Many of the test cases developed for the earlier software acceptance testing may be used again here.

# Chapter 8: Deployment

## Deliverable Product
The developed application allows any browser to locate the system and give the login page. The developed application has a login form for security, a new patient form to add in a new patient, an add a procedure form for the nurse and doctor to add procedures. An about page was included with information and contact details of the clinic. Lastly a logout page to logout of the system.



## User Manual

The deliverable product will be accessed on any browser through the url ,http://jescapaidamoyo.pythonanywhere.com/. The navigation links are clearly stated on the menu bar. Then login with the username, 3113590 /7865632 and password “serviceaboveelse.”  then search for a patient using their patient ID number or add a new patient then use the save patient , enter their details and logout.


## Discussion of results/ further work

The system mainly focused on the receptionist is able to save, search records of patients since 2017. Since the developer started by capturing data from manual files to excel and importing them using sql. The developer wishes to extent their work to making a mobile application for patients so that they can book their appointments in the comfort of their own homes and confirm the availability of the doctor beforehand. The mobile application will capacitate a feature that patients can access their medical records.

## Conclusion

Computers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in every business, industry and research activity, since their use is diverse from entertainment, education, health among others. In hospitals computers are used for patient/employee record keeping, making appointments, calculating bills and managing important information effectively. A thorough analysis of the developed system was conducted and it indicated that it is efficient, usable, and reliable for record management. The application scope could be widened to accommodate a patient’s portal so that they can login to their individual accounts and view their medical records as well as set up appointments.
