## Literature Review

### Theoretical Framework

The application of technology in health care, in the form of Electronic Health Records (EHR), is the most important and necessary issue in order to improve the quality of health care, and studies have shown that, not only is it a way to integrate information and represent the condition of patients, and a dynamic source for health care, however it leads to gain access to clinical information and records, electronic communications, comprehensive training and management, and ultimately, enhancing the public health. (Farzianpour, 2015). For this study, I have applied Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations framework. Rogers’ innovation theory addresses a wide variety of factors that could affect implementation of an innovation; these include attributes of the innovation, the process of implementation, individual characteristics of, and interactions between, the implementers, and organizational factors. (Greiver, 2011) As Rogers explains, innovation is perceived as an idea, process or a technology that is new or unfamiliar to individuals within a particular area or context, while diffusion is the process by which information about the innovation flows from one person to another over time within the social system (WHO 2016b). The National Health Services Education for Scotland observed that, “Without high quality records and efficient flow of information by health records staff, the quality of patient care would be severely compromised” (Attah, 2012). I chose this theory because the idea of Electronic Health Records in Zimbabwe is relatively new and the rate at which it is diffusing is excruciatingly low in both private and public sectors hence I’m using this theory to support the implementation of my capstone project which is to design and develop an electronic patient record management system for Nyanga Family Clinic.

## Literature review


+ Hospitals have been using Electrical Medical Records (EMRs) for laboratory and radiologic reports, radiologic images, medication lists, and some decision-support functions are available in electronic format. Some systems have even upgraded their information to an electronic-records system by adding functionalities, such as computerized provider-order entry, physicians' notes, and nursing assessments. However, these functionalities are typically more difficult to implement, and it remains unclear whether hospitals will be able to do so successfully. EMRs have are a key factor for improving healthcare quality and safety, reducing adverse events for patients, decreasing costs, optimizing processes, improving clinical research and obtaining best clinical performances. However, hospitals continue to experience resistance from professionals to accepting EMRs. “Most hospitals that had adopted electronic-records systems identified financial factors as having a major positive effect on the likelihood of adoption: additional reimbursement for electronic health record use (82%) and financial incentives for adoption (75%). Other facilitators of adoption included the availability of technical support for the implementation of information technology (47%) and objective third-party evaluations of electronic health record products (35%). Hospitals with and those without electronic-records systems were equally likely to cite these factors (P>0.10 for each comparison)” (Placeholder1) (Anna De Benedictis, 2020).
The developer will develop a web based Electronic Medical record system which focuses on patient record management for storing outpatients’ files and will use the parallel changeover method for implementation for doctors to have time to adapt and get used to the system as they’ll see for themselves that the benefits of using an EMR system.

+ Digitalization can bring a paradigm swing in traditional healthcare systems by minimizing medical errors, promoting healthcare quality, reducing healthcare costs and empowering patients to take care of their medical needs (Catwell .L, 2009). Despite the advancements in e-health in other countries, Zimbabwe has little activity where quality healthcare is inaccessible to most of the population in the country (D.S., 2016). Consequently, several technology introductions in Zimbabwe are mainly customized to each hospital and do not communicate with each other. Zimbabwe has very few hospitals that are fully digitalized. According to a study conducted by Samuel S. Furusa and Alfred Coleman on the topic;  Factors influencing e-health implementation by medical doctors in public hospitals in Zimbabwe, the following factors contribute to the why the healthcare sector of Zimbabwe is not yet digitalized:

+	The lack of technology infrastructure and funding to get the devices, 
+	Most clinicians are technical novices, they do not have adequate ICT skills and knowledge
+	Most hospitals do not have an IT department hence resulting in lack of technical support
+	Security  concerns, the violation of doctor patient confidentiality was an issue of concern pertaining to who had access to the system
+	Resistance to change, most clinicians are now accustomed to the manual system arguing that digitalized systems are more difficult to use
+	Lack of basic medical facilities, hospitals lack basic equipment that an advancement in technology will be a luxury

Therefore Digitization makes it easier for patients and healthcare professionals to remain on the same page. Gone are the days when the patients had to maintain a thick medical records file they needed to bring to every medical appointment. Particularly with medical emergencies, patient history is at the mercy of the attendants who may or may not be well-versed with the patient’s profile. Digitization has leveled this platform to keep both patients and their doctors well informed of every situation.
